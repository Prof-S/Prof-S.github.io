Dr. Saeed is a Director of a interdisciplinary research group focusing on machine-learning, parallel and high performance computing focusing on applications-driven algorithmic research, primarily in the area of computational and systems biology. 

In particular, we are particularly interested in solving big data problems in high-throughput proteomics, genomics and connectomics using variety of high-performance architectures and algorithms.

There are **three to four separate research groups** working under Dr. Saeed. You can learn more about my research group and our progress at <https://saeedlab.cis.fiu.edu/> which is a Parallel Computing & Data Science Group.
