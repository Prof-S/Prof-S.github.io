This is my first blog post. This blog is going to be used for science communication, and all the cool sciency things that I can think of. 
Part of this blog is to post things that are related to our papers; other things are ideas that need to be floated and discussed; ofcoures my favourite part is to push scientific theories, and agendas that I will like to puruse
So there it is. Stay tuned and hopefully I will write something useful.
