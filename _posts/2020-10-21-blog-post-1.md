Everyone you talk to will tell you that database search algorithms for proteomics are embarrassingly paralel problem - and is easy to solve. I argue in this blog post that we need a new generation of HPC algorithms for MS based omics. 

For the past 30 years (or more), database-search algorithms, that deduce peptides from Mass Spectrometry (MS) data, have tried to improve the computational efficiency to accomplish larger, and more complex systems biology studies. Poor-scalability with increasing size of theoretical search-space, and search-parameters is a well-known problem in MS based omics. There are excellent works (like MSFragger) that try to reduce the computational complexity and make the process more efficient using smart indexing. We argue that even with these advance serial algorithms HPC algorithms are needed, and wanted (see the end of the blog for why a biologist should care). 

Over the years, number of high-performance computing (HPC) algorithms have been proposed to mitigate this scalability problem with the objective of improved efficiency of underlying arithmetic operations. However, bottleneck for many HPC algorithms have shifted from computational arithmetic operations to communication costs of moving the data between hierarchy of memories, or between memory-distributed pro-cessors; which has dampened overall effectiveness of the existing HPC workflows. Even grappling with scalability issues, communication-avoiding HPC algorithms that can exploit multi-layered parallelism of heterogenous architectures are nearly non-existent. 

In order to make the MS based omics process more efficient we need to design, and develope **communication-avoiding** HPC algorithms which will be an ideal solution for scalable MS data analysis for non-model multispecies databases, that can translate into enormous search-space (several terabytes), against which MS data need to be matched. 

How do we develop communication avoiding HPC algorithms you say? 
How bad the current HPC algorithms might be you say? 

Wait for the next blog post.
